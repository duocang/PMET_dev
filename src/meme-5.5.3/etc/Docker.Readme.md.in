This is the official Docker image for the [MEME Suite](@SOURCE_URL@) collection of tools for motif analysis. 
It is produced by the MEME Suite development team.
The MEME Suite Docker container is available under a limited, non-commercial
use license.  See the [license details](@SOURCE_URL@/doc/copyright.html) here.
If you encounter problems with a MEME Suite Docker image, please contact
[meme-suite@uw.edu](mailto:meme-suite@uw.edu).

This Docker image allows you to easily download, install and run a local copy of
- the MEME Suite command line tools AND
- a MEME Suite web server.
The following instructions assume you have installed Docker Desktop on your 
local computer and it is running.

******
## Using the MEME Suite command line tools via Docker

Type the following command on your computer:

``docker run -v `pwd`:/home/meme -d memesuite/memesuite``

This will download the latest Docker image for MEME Suite
to your computer (if necessary) and start a container running.
Whatever directory (and all its subdirectories) that you run
this command in will be accessible to the container.
(You can also download and run <b>previous</b> versions of the MEME Suite and run Docker
appending the appropriate tag after `memesuite/memesuite`, e.g.,
`memesuite/memesuite:5.5.0`.)

To run MEME Suite commands, you can open a terminal in the container.
First, go to Docker Desktop and select the running container by clicking on its name.
This should open a page with the tabs `Logs`, `Inspect`,
`Terminal` and `Stats`. Click on the `Terminal` tab.
This will open a terminal where you can run all of the MEME Suite command line tools
including, MEME, MAST, STREME, XSTREME etc.

For example, if the directory where you executed the `docker run`
command contains a FASTA protein sequences file named `adh.fa`,
you can run MEME on the sequences by simply typing the following command in the terminal:

``meme adh.fa``

The result file or folder generated by any MEME Suite commands that you execute 
will be in the directory where you ran the `docker run` command, or in one of its subdirectories
if you redirected the output of the MEME Suite command.

You can list all of the available MEME Suite command line tools by typing the following
command in the container:

``ls /opt/meme/bin ; ls /opt/meme/libexec/meme-@ARCHIVE_VERSION@``

**Note:** If your computer has multiple CPUs you can run MEME in
parallel mode, using `meme -p n` where `n` is the number of CPUs available.
This will greatly reduce running time.  You can also specify the `-meme-p`
switch to MEME-ChiP and the `--meme-p` switch to XSTREME, which will
greatly reduce their running times as well.

**Note:** If you run STREME with large input files, you may need to add 
`-m 10g --memory-swap 10g` to the `docker run` command above.


******
## Running a Local MEME Suite Web Server Using Docker

To run your own MEME Suite web server on your computer, enter the following command in a terminal:

``docker run -v `pwd`:/home/meme -d -p 8080:8080 memesuite/memesuite``

This will run the latest MEME Suite Docker image in a Docker container on your computer.
Allow two or three minutes for the web server to be completely initialized.
The MEME Suite web server will then be available on your computer at URL:

[http://localhost:8080/meme_@ARCHIVE_VERSION@](http://localhost:8080/meme_@ARCHIVE_VERSION@)

(You can also download earlier versions of the MEME Suite and run Docker
appending the appropriate tag after `memesuite/memesuite`, e.g.,
`memesuite/memesuite:5.5.0`.  You will then access MEME at a URL that includes
the appropriate version number.)

You can also open a terminal in the running Docker container (see the previous section)
and run MEME Suite command line tools.

Your local MEME Suite web server will have the motif databases and the GoMo databases installed,
but no sequence databases or T-Gene databases.  However, you can download and install 
sequence databases and/or the T-Gene databases on your local
computer and then make them accessible to the Docker MEME Suite container. 

**Note:** If you run STREME with large input files, you may need to add 
`-m 10g --memory-swap 10g` to the `docker run` command above.

## Installing Sequence Databases for Docker

You can download genome sequence database archives for model organisms from 
[@SOURCE_URL@/doc/download.html](@SOURCE_URL@/doc/download.html#seq_dbs).
There are archives for **Human** (hg16, hg17, hg18, hg19, hg38);
**Mouse** (mm7, mm8, mm9, mm10, mm39);
**Rat** (rn3, rn4, rn5, rn6, rn7);
**Frog** (xenTro1, xenTro2, xenTro3, xenTro7, xenTro9, xenTro10);
**Zebrafish** (danRer3, danRer4, danRer5, danRer6, danRer7, danRer10, danRer11);
**Drosophila** (dm1, dm2, dm3, dm6);
**Worm** (ce2, ce4, ce6, ce10, ce11);
**Yeast** (sacCer1, sacCer2, sacCer3 and Schizosaccaromyces Pombe);
**Arabidoposis thaliana** (TAIR10);
and 
**Rice** (IRGSP-1.0).
There is also an archive containing the three most recent genome versions of each of 
the above **Model Organisms**.
Download the database file archive that you want to your computer and then expand it.
Create a soft link to this database directory with the name `fasta_databases` in 
the directory where you exectued the `docker run` command.
You can download more than one of the archives and switch between them
by simply changing the target of the `fasta_databases` soft link you created:

```
cd some/local/directory 
tar xzvf your_downloaded_archive_name.tgz 
cd directory/where/you/did/docker/run/command
ln -s your_downloaded_archive_name fasta_databases
```

To make the sequence databases visible to your local Docker web server,
restart the Docker container (or start it using the command from the previous section).
You can restart a running container within Docker Desktop using the restart button in
the upper left corner screen after you select the the container.

**Note:** You will only be able to access the FASTA databases you installed if they
are in a directory at or below the directory where you did the Docker run command.

If you require genome, proteome or upstream sequences not available in the archives listed
above, you can use the [update-sequence-db](@SOURCE_URL@/doc/update-sequence-db.html) command
from within the running Docker container to create your own sequence archive.
In Docker Desktop, open the `Terminal Tab` of the running container and type

``/opt/meme/libexec/meme-@ARCHIVE_VERSION@/update-sequence-db --the_databases_you_want fasta_databases``

See the help page (above) for more information on `update-sequence-db`.

  
******
## Installing the T-Gene Databases for Docker

The procedure for installing the T-Gene databases is similar to that for sequence
databases (previous section).  Download the T-Gene database archive 
from [@SOURCE_URL@/doc/download.html](@SOURCE_URL@/doc/download.html).
Expand it using the `tar` command.  Then soft link the expanded directory to `tgene_databases`
in the directory where you will run Docker.  Then start (or restart) the Docker container.
